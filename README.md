# Association between food outlets and adolescent obesity

This repository contains the whole process of the research to explore the association between spatial  distribution of food outlets and adolescent obesity.
A ![spatial data matrix](/Images/Process_of_building_a_spatial_data_matrix) with fields representing the accessibility of food outlets and adolescent obesity rate was first built, then a series of regression models were established and optimized.

The research will be published on a journal soon.
